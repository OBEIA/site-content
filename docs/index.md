## Welcome

[Apollo](https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo) is an "open autonomous driving platform" intended for the development of autonomous cars. Initially announced in 2017, it has since developed in various aspects toward driverless driving, with an emphasis on security and safety as the vehicle drives in more complex situations. Methods such as deep learning have been implemented in its software, improving aspects of its autonomy such as perception; further details may be found on [its releases page](https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo/releases).

The architecture of a software system such as Apollo is an integral aspect of its evolution; the system's development is intricately affected by how the architecture has been defined, and any changes or additions may cause a heavy impact to both. Over the course of our project, OBEIA will be studying Apollo to gain an understanding of the development of its architecture, notably that of 7.0. Our site will record our findings from the architecture's concept recovery to its concrete build, ending with a possible enhancement and how the architecture would be affected.
